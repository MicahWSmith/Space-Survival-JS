<h2>Gameplay Scene</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gameplay in endless, and gets harder as you destroy enemy ships. The ENEMIES LEFT label shows how many ships need to be destroyed before the next jump in difficulty.</li>
  <li>The ROUND label denotes how many times diffuculty has increased. Difficulty increasing means both you and the enemy ships move faster.</li>
  <li>POWERUPS look like orange or grey orbs and randomly drop from destroyed ships.</li>
  <li>SCORE is gained by destroying enemy ships and picking up powerups. HIGHSCORE is stored and retrieved by local storage with the browser.</li>
  <li>Picking up a powerup also gives you a finite stackable amount of SPECIAL AMMO which fires rapidly by holding spacebar.</li>
  <li>LIVES shows an arrangement of ships, representing how many times you can collide with enemy ships before having to reset the game</li>
</ul>
